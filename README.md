# Churn-Rate-Classifier

This data exploration project is an in-depth analysis consisting of a machine learning model to predict the churn rate of consumers of telecom companies.

This was primarly developed and coded with Python's data science and machine learning tools and libraries including Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, and Scikit Learn.

The Single Decision Trees and Boosted Trees machine learning models are implemented.
Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression can also be used to model the data.

To run this on your machine, ensure that Anaconda is installed (it comes with preinstalled data science and machine learning libraries that are used for this investigation).
